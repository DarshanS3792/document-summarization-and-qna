If you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular\\ncontact with him, getting over him may not be possible. What makes it even trickier is that his actions\\n(hugs and touching) may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is\\npossible. Some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else\\nor when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light. If you truly want to\\nforce yourself to get over him, cutting contact&nbsp;or setting strict boundaries may be necessary. If\\nyou don't see him, over time you can begin to forget about him. If you set boundaries by discontinuing\", metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\SaiShiva Gudla\\\\source\\\\doc-summarization-and-qna-main/knowledge_base\\\\Mentalhealthdata.pdf'}),\n",
